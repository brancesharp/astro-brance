				I've worked in marketing and sales for some time now, but my introduction into digital
				marketing and automation started in late 2022. Since that time I've had the chance to
				on a number of projects aimed at generating leads and driving revenue. I'm happy to have
				had the chance to work with some amazing people on some great marketing campaigns, mostly
				within the medical devices industry.
