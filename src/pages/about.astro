                Hi, I'm a digital marketer and self-taught programmer from California. I'm currently working as a marketing automation 
                specialist in the medical devices industry. My work is centered around lead generation and automation - turning visitors
                into customers through personalized advertising. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in programming came about in 2022. I started learning to program using Python, using libraries like pandas
                and NumPy for data analysis. More recently I've been learning Go and Javascript for web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm available for work as a digital marketing and automation specialist - if you'd like to work together, you can find out 
                more <a href="/contact"><strong>here.</strong></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy running and I am an avid mountain biker. In my free time, I can usually be found exploring the bike trails
                near my home on the Central Coast of California.
            </p>
